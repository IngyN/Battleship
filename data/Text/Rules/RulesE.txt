The game is based on two opponents,each having their on board and ships. 
The objective is to sink all of the opponent's ships before they sink yours.
Each player has 10 ships: 1 battleship, 2 cruisers, 3 destroyers, and 4 submarines.
At the beginning of the game the player sets up their board and the computer does too.
The player cannot place to ships touching.
After the ships have been positioned, the game begins.
In each round, the player and the opponent take turns shooting at the grids of each other.
If the player’s shot is a "hit", meaning that the player was able to strike an 
opponent’s ship, it will be marked as a hit in the tracking grid 
in order to build up a picture of the opponent's fleet. 
If the opponent’s shot was a hit, it will be marked as a hit on the player’s grid in the same way.

A player takes another shot on the same turn if the player was able to successfully 
hit an enemy’s ship.

When all of the squares of a ship have been hit, the ship is sunk (turns red),
and the surrounding squares are marked hit as well.

If all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over and their opponent wins.
